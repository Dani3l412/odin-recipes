   <h4>Steps</h4>
   <ol>
       <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; season with salt.
        Bring the water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the pot
        and cook the potatoes at a simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir the onion,
        green bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble the ground beef into the onion mixture, breaking the meat into smaller pieces as
        you mix; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain as much
        fat from the mixture as possible.</li>
        <li>Stir the red wine, tomato sauce, olives, capers, golden raisins, cumin, oregano, black pepper,
        and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the ground beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low,
        and cook at a simmer until the wine had reduced significantly, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel the cooled potatoes and cut into chunks.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <LI>Gently fold the cooked potatoes into the simmering ground beef mixture; cook together 5 minutes.</LI>
