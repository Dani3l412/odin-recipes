    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 clovers garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups grated Percorino Romano Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the
            boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about
            10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir
            until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in
            1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add
            more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
